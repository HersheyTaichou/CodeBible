# MediCat USB

This is a USB bootable utility with a wide array of tools that can be used outside of the installed OS and can perform tasks that cannot be done on a running system

## How to Install

They have two installer options, the first is a bat file that will download and install the programs to a bootable flash drive. The second is a disk image that can be imaged to the drive.

Both options can be found on the [Medicat USB](https://medicatusb.com) website

## How to Configure

You should not need to do any initial configuration of the drive, but you may need to adjust the boot settings of the machine you are working on, to boot from the USB.

## How to Use

Insert the USB drive into the computer to work on, then reboot. Press the key to select a boot option (Often F12), as the system is coming up, then select the USB drive from the menu.
