## How to Use

Once you have it downloaded, you will need to run it as an administrator. From the actions menu, you can choose which settings to toggle automatically. Before changing any settings, it is highly recommended that you create a system restore point. That can be done through Windows or the Action menu.

Clicking on the name of the settings will open a brief overview of what that setting affects.

### Apply only recommended settings

This is the option I have used, it will check off everything green in the Recommended column. I suggest you still go through and see if anything that is checked off will affect your workflow.

For instance, I will un-check "Disable storage of clipboard history" after running this action

### Recommended and somewhat recommended settings

This option will check off everything green and yellow in the Recommended column. Usually, this option is also pretty safe, but you should review everything switched before or after running this, to make sure nothing you need is disabled.

For instance, this option will disable app access to the Camera and Microphone. It will also disable biometrical features, which will prevent logging in with a fingerprint or facial recognition.

### Apply all setting

This option can be extremely dangerous. It will toggle on all the settings the software can, and has a very high likelihood of breaking things or causing other issues.
