title: Code Reference Repository

## Introduction

This is my collection of notes, commands, and basic scripts I will use when performing troubleshooting, data collection, or object management tasks.

It also includes a lot of things I've documented while setting up my home lab environment.

## Getting Started

This has been setup as a Quartz site, which can be viewed at [docs.oriontech.info](https://docs.oriontech.info). You can view the original Markdown files in the original Github repository, [here](https://github.com/HersheyTaichou/CodeBible). 

## CodeBible PowerShell Module

Work has begun on migrating some of the scripts to PowerShell functions, which will be included in a module, so the script can be run with one command. The module can be found [here](https://github.com/HersheyTaichou/CodeBible-Module)

The original scripts will remain, for reference or for when you need to run them on a machine but do not want to download and import the module. Migrated functions will have a note before the script, to inform you that it is part of the module.

I am always open to suggestions of things that you have found helpful, or ways I can improve the documentation on the scripts and notes present in this repository.
