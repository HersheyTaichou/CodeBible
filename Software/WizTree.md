# WizTree

WizTree allows you to see what is using up the space on a computer. It is very much like WinDirStat, but faster.

## How to Install

You can download the installer from the [Disk Analyzer](https://diskanalyzer.com/) website and run it.

It can also be installed with Chocolatey:

```PowerShell
choco install wiztree
```

## How to Use

In the top left corner, select the drive or folder to scan, then click Scan

After just a few moments, you should get a breakdown of folders and a block diagram at the bottom demonstrating where the space in the drive or folder is being used up.
