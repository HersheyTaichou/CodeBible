# Ventoy

Ventoy is an open-source tool to create one bootable USB drive for ISO/WIM/IMG/VHD(x)/EFI files. With Ventoy, you don't need to format the disk over and over, you just need to copy the ISO/WIM/IMG/VHD(x)/EFI files to the USB drive and boot them directly.

More information can be found on the [Ventoy website](https://www.ventoy.net/)

## How to Install

The latest release can be downloaded from the [Ventoy GitHub](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/releases) releases page.

You will want to download the Windows zip file, then extract it. 

Run the Ventoy2Disk.exe file, and insert the USB drive you want to use. Make sure the correct USB drive is selected, then click Install.

## How to Use

Once it is installed all you will need to do is copy any ISO files you want to have as boot options to the Ventoy drive. They can even be organized into folders if needed.

When ready to use, insert the USB drive into the target machine, reboot, and boot from the drive. Ventoy will give you a list of all the ISO files available to boot from, and you can select one to boot.
