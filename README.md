# Code Reference Repository

## Introduction

This is my collection of notes, commands, and basic scripts I will use when performing troubleshooting, data collection, or object management tasks

## Getting Started

This repository can be viewed on GitHub's website, or you can sync it locally with your preferred utility. When used for reference, it may be easiest to use the website or a program that previews markdown files, as that will make it much easier to read.

### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) can be downloaded from Microsoft for free. The installation is fairly straightforward, and it includes git capabilities built-in.

While the VSCode installation is running, you can log into GitHub and fork this repository, if you want a personal copy to make changes to.

Once you have VSCode installed, you want to go to the Source Control tab on the left and click on the option to Clone a repository.

At the top, it will give you the option to paste a URL or log in to GitHub. You can paste the link from the Code dropdown at the top, or log in to your account and sync your copy of the repo

Finally, it will ask you where you want to want to store the local copy of your repository.
